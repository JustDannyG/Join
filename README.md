# Join – Kanban App

Join is a simple Kanban-style task management app built as a portfolio project.  
It helps you organize tasks across boards/columns and manage your workflow with an intuitive UI.

## Features
- Kanban board with columns (boards/spalten)
- Drag & Drop to move tasks between columns
- Create, edit and delete tasks
- Login (demo authentication / app access)
- Filter & search to quickly find tasks
- Data persistence via Local Storage

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Local Storage
- Firebase API (used in the project setup)

## How It Works
- Tasks are managed in a Kanban board (e.g. To Do / In Progress / Done).
- Changes (create/update/move) are saved so your tasks remain available on the next visit.
